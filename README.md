# Windows Malware

## Installation

> Please use a VM to test the malware, I am not responsible for any damage done to your system.

Go to Github [releases](https://github.com/chirag-droid/Malware/releases) and download the NSIS installer. This installer will run in user mode and guide you through the installation process. The installer will also setup an uninstaller so its easy for you to uninstall the malware. When installed your windows will crash on next reboot or instantly.

Please not down the path where you install it.

The install process can be done silently but I don't want people misusing this.

## Uninstallation

Start windows in [safe mode](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode-in-windows-92c27cff-db89-8644-1ce4-b3e5e56fe234), navigate to the folder where you installed the malware.

Run the `uninstall.exe` which will remove the malware from your system and reboot normally.
